This project is performed by following the instructions at chapter 2 of Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow.
The California Housing data set is used in the porject and all the steps taken during a machine learning project is applied in this project.
The code for the project is provided in the book and I have explained each step and why each step is performed.
